# My C sideprojects
---
So I am learning **C** by making small *side projects* and this is a mono-repo where i upload all of them :)

**So far i made:**
1. [Snake game](/snake-game)
2. [Digital Clock](/clock)
3. [Colorfull progress bars](/progress-bar)
4. [Banking System](/banking-system)
5. [Sudoku solver](/sudoku-solver)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> you can run most of them using the `gcc file.c` command but i would recommend checking the projects' own `README.md` just in case they need extra libraries like [snake game](/snake-game)!

these are simple things so please dont mind if i dont make enough checks or anything.
